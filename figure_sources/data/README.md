# Figure data

Small structured inputs used by publication figures and tables live here.

`mesoscope-laser-power.csv` transcribes the lookup values embedded in the Google Doc image exported as `images/figures/imported/mesoscope-laser-power-table.png`. The PNG remains as source provenance; Methods links to a MyST hover preview of the accessible table without reserving permanent page space.

`experimental-animals.csv` is a snapshot of the linked public mouse worksheet, with source URL and source/vendored checksums recorded in `experimental-animals.provenance.json`. It supplies individual mouse metadata to the interactive explorer. Hidden imported source tables retain the grouped manuscript data needed for deterministic generation but are not shown beside the record-level explorer. Individual session rows are expanded from the grouped session IDs in that source.

`experimental-sessions.csv` is a complete snapshot of the public worksheet's EPHYS, MESO, and SLAP2 records in source order. Repeated and aborted rows are retained so the three static modality panels reproduce the supplied plotting rules; this snapshot is intentionally separate from the grouped interactive inventory. Its XLSX source URL, retrieval date, modality counts, dimensions, and checksums are recorded in `experimental-sessions.provenance.json`.

`data-access.csv` is the publication snapshot of the public `DATA ACCESS SUMMARY` worksheet. The interactive explorer reads only this local file, so publication builds are deterministic and do not contact Google Sheets. Its source URL, retrieval date, row count, modality counts, and checksums are recorded in `data-access.provenance.json`.

Maintainers can refresh and commit all three publication tables by manually running the **Update publication table snapshots** GitHub Actions workflow. To refresh them locally, install `pandas` and `python-calamine`, then run `python scripts/update_publication_snapshots.py`. Pass `--snapshot experimental-animals`, `--snapshot experimental-sessions`, or `--snapshot data-access` to refresh only one table.

`other-oddball-studies.csv` is the complete 17-row by 6-column source for Supplementary Table 1. Its Google Sheets URL, retrieval date, dimensions, and checksums are recorded in `other-oddball-studies.provenance.json`.

`neuropixels-unit-yield.csv` contains one row for each unit-bearing session NWB in the July 30, 2026 snapshot of draft Dandiset 001637. It records total units, units passing all three manuscript QC thresholds, and the available `Probe*` electrode groups. The DANDI asset-manifest checksum, thresholds, skipped schema-only NWBs, and vendored checksum are recorded in `neuropixels-unit-yield.provenance.json`. Regenerate it with `uv run --with h5py --with numpy --with remfile python scripts/extract_neuropixels_unit_yield.py`.

## Optotagging results

`optotagging-results.parquet` is the per-unit statistical output of the
Neuropixels optotagging analysis. It is derived from the public session NWBs in
[DANDI:001637](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001637/draft/files). The
analysis requires the NWB `units` table and all three interval tables:
`raised_cosine_presentations`, `5 hz pulse train_presentations`, and
`40 hz pulse train_presentations`. Units whose `decoder_label` is `noise` are
excluded; no additional unit-quality thresholds are applied when constructing
this table.

Each interval-table presentation is expanded into laser-pulse onset times using
the condition frequency. Every output row represents one `(session_id,
unit_id)` pair and contains `asset_id`, `asset_path`, and four metrics for each
condition:

- `pre_mean`: mean pre-laser firing rate across pulses, in spikes/s.
- `post_mean`: mean post-laser firing rate across pulses, in spikes/s.
- `modulation_index`: the mean finite pulse-level value of
  `(post_rate - pre_rate) / (post_rate + pre_rate)`. Pulses for which both rates
  are zero have an undefined modulation index and are omitted from this mean.
- `p_value`: two-sided paired Wilcoxon signed-rank p-value comparing the
  pulse-level pre- and post-laser firing rates. The implementation uses
  `scipy.stats.wilcoxon(pre_rates, post_rates, zero_method="zsplit",
  correction=False)`.

Spike counts use half-open windows, so a spike at a window's start is included
and a spike exactly at its end is excluded. All times below are relative to an
individual laser-pulse onset:

| Condition | Pulse width | Pre-rate window | Post-rate window |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Raised cosine | 1 s | `[-0.501, -0.001)` s | `[0.250, 0.750)` s |
| 5 Hz pulse train | 10 ms | `[-0.011, -0.001)` s | `[0.002, 0.012)` s |
| 40 Hz pulse train | 6 ms | `[-0.011, -0.001)` s | `[0.002, 0.012)` s |

The 40 Hz statistical post window intentionally remains 10 ms to reproduce the
reference analysis, although the physical laser pulse and the heatmap-ordering
window are 6 ms. The Parquet file contains summary metrics only; the 1 ms PSTHs
used by the viewer are not stored in it.

The implementation is in
[`src/openscope_p3_publication/optotagging.py`](../../src/openscope_p3_publication/optotagging.py).
To regenerate the complete table, open the marimo notebook, choose **All
sessions**, and run the analysis:

```powershell
uv run --with dandi --with h5py --with iblatlas --with iblutil --with marimo `
  --with matplotlib --with numpy --with pandas --with pyarrow --with remfile `
  --with scipy --with seaborn marimo edit optotagging_analysis.py
```

By default, the notebook writes `optotagging-results.parquet` and
`optotagging-results.provenance.json` to
`~/Data/openscope_p3_data_release_paper/`. The provenance document records the
DANDI version and asset inventory, output checksum, condition parameters,
excluded sessions, and failed sessions. When updating the committed snapshot,
copy both generated files into `figure_sources/data/` together.

From the repository root, load the committed table with:

```python
from pathlib import Path

import pandas as pd

results_path = Path("figure_sources/data/optotagging-results.parquet")
optotagging_results = pd.read_parquet(results_path)
```

Putative optotagged SST cells are identified from the 5 Hz pulse-train response
only, requiring `p_value < 0.05` and `modulation_index > 0.1`:

```python
condition = "5 hz pulse train_presentations"
is_optotagged = (
    optotagging_results[f"{condition}__p_value"].lt(0.05)
    & optotagging_results[f"{condition}__modulation_index"].gt(0.1)
)
putative_sst_cells = optotagging_results.loc[is_optotagged].copy()
```

These should be described as putative optotagged SST cells rather than
transcriptomically confirmed SST cells. The raised-cosine and 40 Hz metrics
remain in the table even though they are not part of this classification rule.
Providing results for every stimulation condition allows users to define a
stricter criterion, such as requiring consistent responses across conditions,
or to apply an alternative classification appropriate for their analysis.

`neuropixels-trajectories.json` contains all 332 CCF-localized probe insertions from 57 of the 60 Neuropixels session NWBs in the source inventory, together with each insertion's contiguous CCF area profile and a 100-micrometer whole-brain surface derived from the Allen CCF 2017 25-micrometer annotation volume. Three sessions without electrode `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates are retained as explicit exclusions in `neuropixels-trajectories.provenance.json`. The provenance record also pins the DANDI inventory, Allen annotation volume, structure graph, and vendored checksums. Regenerate both files with `uv run --with h5py --with numpy --with pynrrd --with remfile --with scikit-image python scripts/extract_neuropixels_trajectories.py`. When only the shared A-F display palette changes, update colors and the vendored checksum without re-fetching NWBs by adding `--refresh-palette-only`.

`raw-neural-excerpts.json` and `figure_sources/media/neural-viewer/` contain the source-backed raw-data excerpts used by Figure 5. Neuropixels shaft views encode 100 ms of calibrated, unaveraged 30-kHz voltage from 96 regularly spaced contacts in each public compressed AP Zarr store; contiguous CCF structure and layer segments come from the NWB electrode-location annotations. Mesoscope sheets contain raw uncompressed ScanImage pages selected by synchronized NWB plane timestamps. Their spatial scale comes from the NWB imaging-plane grid spacing (0.78 µm per native pixel). SLAP2 sheets map native detector samples from DMD1/DMD2 acquisition trial 26 onto acquisition-plan superpixels and a structural reference; acquisition metadata supplies each remote-focus depth below pia, and the acquisition-coordinate transform supplies the 0.25 µm native-pixel scale. The four selectable single-channel movies and two aligned green/red composite sheets use 400 × 640 frames after a 2× spatial reduction and publication-level transpose of the native 1280 × 800 acquisition-coordinate raster, placing fast x vertically; sheets use lossless WebP encoding. The source payload retains synchronized event metadata for deterministic extraction and provenance, while the viewer exposes only elapsed excerpt time and does not mark stimulus onset. The payload records NWB checksums, S3 metadata, fetched-range and sheet checksums, native rates, native and display dimensions, spatial calibrations, and the checksum of `behavior-excerpts.json`. On macOS, install the WavPack decoder with `brew install wavpack`, then regenerate with `uv run --with h5py --with numpy --with remfile --with s3fs --with 'zarr<3' --with wavpack-numcodecs --with pillow==12.3.0 --with tifffile==2026.7.14 python scripts/extract_raw_neural_excerpts.py`.

`raw-neural-static-frames.provenance.json` and `figure_sources/media/neural-viewer-static/` record ten middle frames used by Figure 5's Static view: all eight mesoscope planes and two SLAP2 DMD composites. Each PNG is tied to its source sprite-sheet checksum and frame index. To make structure legible while preserving pseudocolor hue, mesoscope stills receive an independent max-channel linear stretch from their 1st to 99.5th percentile. Each SLAP2 still merges aligned iGluSnFR4f and RCaMP3 channels, independently scaled from their 1st to 99.5th sampled-pixel percentiles, rendered in green and red, and brightened with a max-channel hue-preserving gamma of 0.55. No temporal averaging is applied. After refreshing the raw excerpt payload, regenerate these small derived frames with `uv run --with pillow python scripts/extract_raw_neural_static_frames.py`.

`segmentation-viewers.json` and `figure_sources/media/segmentation-viewers/` contain compact, source-backed unit-extraction views for the three recording modalities. The Neuropixels snapshot uses all 3,550 sorted units from Probes A-F, with unit and depth metadata, peak-channel mean templates, spike times, electrode geometry, and one 96-contact by 3,000-sample AP excerpt per probe from session `ecephys_830846_2026-03-09_10-32-54` in DANDI:001637. Detected spikes within each 100 ms excerpt are retained as aligned overlays; the browser applies median-across-contact common-mode correction independently at every sample by default and provides a toggle for viewing the uncorrected data. The mesoscope snapshot uses all 2,384 masks from eight VISp and VISl planes, classification probabilities, grayscale average projections, and 30 s elapsed-time ΔF/F excerpts from session `multiplane-ophys_832700_2026-01-29_11-18-09` in DANDI:001768. The SLAP2 snapshot uses all 119 `PlaneSegmentation` masks from DMD1 and DMD2, grayscale mean images, and 30 s, approximately 200 Hz elapsed-time ΔF/F excerpts from session `SLAP2_796630_2025-08-28_14-25-34` in DANDI:001424. The combined browser figure exposes every probe or plane through Neuropixels, Mesoscope, and SLAP2 tabs. Mesoscope images retain their stored display (y, x) orientation, with fast x horizontal; SLAP2 base images, labels, and masks receive the same publication-level axis transpose, placing fast x vertically. No segmentation viewer payload exposes stimulus labels, context metadata, SNR, or firing rate. The browser reads these committed compact snapshots; it does not stream NWB data at page load. The provenance record pins each asset UUID, path, direct blob URL, SHA-256, and every vendored image checksum. Regenerate the snapshot by streaming the pinned NWBs with `uv run --with h5py --with numpy --with remfile --with pillow==12.3.0 python scripts/extract_segmentation_viewers.py`.

`behavior-static-frames.provenance.json` and `figure_sources/media/behavior-viewer-static/` record 10 camera stills used by Figure 8's Static view. Each row's stills and running profile now use the same mouse and source session. Neuropixels and mesoscope retain the synchronized 8-second excerpt selection; SLAP2 uses video time 600 seconds from the full-session profile source. Each JPEG is tied to its mouse, session, public MP4 URL, ETag, content length, source-video target time, decoded frame time, and output checksum. Every frame receives an independent 1st–99th luminance-percentile stretch plus bounded adaptive gamma targeting 35% median luminance; all display parameters are recorded. Refresh all stills with `uv run --with av --with pillow python scripts/extract_behavior_static_frames.py`, or only SLAP2 with `--modality slap2`.

`running-statistics.json` contains block-aware locomotion summaries for every P3 worksheet session with public running and protocol-timing sources. Neuropixels and mesoscope values come from DANDI NWB running-speed series and named interval tables. SLAP2 values come from the native signed 16-bit Harp quadrature counter and row-aligned stimulus pulses; counts are unwrapped and converted with the pinned acquisition convention of 8192 counts/revolution, an 8.255 cm disc radius, and a 2/3 effective running radius. All sources are integrated to position and differenced into common 50 ms bins. Negative velocity is set to zero before calculating mean forward speed. Session means are retained for every measured block. Repeated complete sessions are then averaged within mouse for each block, supplying one point per mouse in panel D's shared-axis grouped modality plot. Three source-backed example profiles retain 5-second means and all eight measured block windows. The payload records worksheet coverage, exclusions, DANDI asset manifests, raw Harp checksums, stimulus-pulse provenance, and calibration provenance. Regenerate it with `uv run --with h5py --with harp-python --with numpy --with remfile python scripts/extract_running_statistics.py --cache-dir /tmp/openscope-p3-running-cache`.

`stimulus-table-excerpts/` contains compact, checksum-verified excerpts from all four pinned example tables. Context excerpts span approximately 24 seconds around the first true mismatch; shared-block excerpts preserve the first approximately 24 seconds of each generated control block. Source row and trial numbers are retained.
