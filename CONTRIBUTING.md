# Contributing

## Manuscript changes

We welcome contributions from OpenScope Predictive Processing Community members. Coordinate substantial scientific or structural changes in an issue or discussion before starting so parallel edits do not conflict.

1. Create a focused branch from the latest `main` and edit `index.md` using MyST Markdown.
2. Preserve the manuscript's section structure, MyST labels, citations, terminology, and figure numbering unless the pull request explicitly proposes a coordinated change.
3. Support scientific claims with a citation or source-backed project record. Do not infer results or provenance.
4. Keep prose, figure, and data-snapshot changes narrowly scoped. Separate unrelated scientific revisions when practical.
5. Update generated files in the same pull request as their source; never edit generated outputs without updating their owner.
6. In the pull request, summarize the scientific change, identify source data or references, list regenerated assets, report validation, and request review from the relevant section or data owner.

During the Google Doc cutover, `scripts/import_google_doc.py` is destructive: it replaces `index.md`, imported PNGs, and their manifest. Do not run it over repository-only edits that have not been reconciled with the source document.

## Authorship metadata

Add or update your contribution through the [P3 data-release contribution form](https://data.allenneuraldynamics.org/contributions/add?project=p3_data_release). Do not edit contributor records directly in `authors.yml`; it is a generated snapshot of the contribution portal.

After changing your portal record, notify the repository maintainer and request an authorship snapshot refresh. Do not run `scripts/sync_authors.py`; authorship synchronization and the resulting commit are maintainer-only operations.

The maintainer-run sync pins the newest portal commit and maps its ORCID, affiliation, CRediT-level, and section-level records into the structure consumed by [AuthorshipExtractor](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/AuthorshipExtractor). Do not infer or assign contributions on another person's behalf; authors should review their own portal record.

For a one-time reviewed refresh, a maintainer may pass `--review-file /path/outside/the/clone/approval.json`. Keep this file outside the repository. It identifies the reviewed portal version and the approved contributors by their exact submitted names, with optional explicitly confirmed name or section corrections:

```json
{
	"project": "p3_data_release",
	"commit": "<reviewed portal commit>",
	"contributors": {
		"First Submitted Name": {},
		"Second Submitted Name": {
			"name": "Confirmed Publication Name",
			"sections": {
				"Neuropixels data validation": "Mesoscope data validation"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Only the listed contributors are included, in portal order. The sync reads that exact version, preserves submitted records, roles, effort levels, and other metadata, and marks the generated snapshot as reviewed without recording the local review file or its approval list in provenance. Unknown names, ambiguous names, and invalid section corrections stop the refresh. The review applies only to that invocation: omitting `--review-file` restores the normal full-portal refresh. Run the publication checks after regenerating the snapshot.

Portrait links are maintained in the editable `author_portrait_sources.json`. Use clearly identified portraits from authoritative institutional, laboratory, or author-controlled academic profiles, record the source page and measured image dimensions, and leave uncertain identities unresolved. Images remain remotely hosted; do not bundle downloaded portraits. Prefer large images, but verified profile thumbnails of at least 128 pixels in each dimension can be used for the small author avatars without upscaling the source. A record-level `verified_on` date applies to that portrait; otherwise the manifest-level date applies. To refresh portraits, a maintainer adds `--avatar-source author_portrait_sources.json` to the sync command, along with any current local `--review-file`. This regenerates both `author_avatars.json` and the avatar URLs in `authors.yml`; never hand-edit either generated file. Validate that author identities, order, and contributions are unchanged after a portrait-only refresh.

## Figures

Every figure needs:

1. An editable source or a stable source URL under `figure_sources/`.
2. Any small tabular input under `figure_sources/data/`, or a versioned external-data manifest for large inputs.
3. Reproducible generation code in `src/openscope_p3_publication/`, `figure_sources/python/`, or a committed notebook.
4. A rendered web asset in `images/figures/`.
5. A stable MyST label, descriptive alternative text, and a manuscript caption that defines panels, encodings, units, sample sizes, exclusions, and source data.
6. For every interactive figure, a scientifically complete static counterpart generated from the same validated inputs for PDF, print, and other noninteractive exports.

Do not commit NWB files or other large primary datasets. Cite a versioned DANDI asset or project S3 asset and record its URL, path, version or DOI, retrieval date, and any required checksum.

## Repository health and binary files

This repository intentionally versions small binary sources needed to edit and reproduce the manuscript, including Illustrator, PowerPoint, Word, image, and short media files. Git history is effectively permanent: deleting a large file in a later commit does not recover the space, and each revision of a binary may add nearly the file's full size again.

Use these limits for each new or replacement file:

| File size | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 10 MiB | Regular Git is acceptable when the file is required for the manuscript, a figure source, or the published site. |
| 10 MiB through 100 MiB | Get maintainer approval before committing. Explain why the file belongs in Git and why it cannot be reduced or stored externally. GitHub warns for files larger than 50 MiB. |
| More than 100 MiB | Do not commit it to regular Git; GitHub rejects the file. Use a versioned external data store instead. |

There is no project-specific total-size cap below GitHub's current repository limits. Maintainers should monitor growth and repository health as the manuscript evolves. A pull request that adds or replaces more than 25 MiB of binary content in total requires maintainer review, even when every individual file is below 10 MiB.

Before committing a binary file:

1. Confirm that it is needed to edit, reproduce, review, or publish the manuscript. Do not commit caches, temporary exports, autosaves, operating-system metadata, or local environments.
2. Commit one canonical copy. If the build or deployment needs the file at another path, generate an ignored copy during the build instead of committing both paths.
3. Prefer meaningful source revisions over repeated autosave or export commits. Compress images and media without compromising their scientific content.
4. Keep primary datasets and analysis-scale derived datasets in DANDI or another stable, versioned store. Commit a URL or DOI, version identifier, checksum, and retrieval instructions instead. Compact display payloads for interactive figures may be committed when they follow the requirements below.
5. Inspect staged changes with `git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat`. If a large file was staged accidentally, remove it from the index before committing with `git restore --staged <path>`.

Git LFS is not currently configured and is not recommended for this repository. It adds separate storage and bandwidth accounting, collaborator setup, and CI, Pages, and archival constraints. Store files above GitHub's regular Git limit in DANDI or another stable, versioned external store. Do not enable Git LFS without an explicit project-level decision.

Maintainers should periodically run `git count-objects -vH` and inspect the repository with [git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer), especially before a release or after merging media-heavy work.

## Static and interactive figures with MyST

Choose the simplest format that communicates the scientific result clearly. Use a static figure for a fixed result, comparison, schematic, or composition that must read completely in HTML, PDF, print, and archival exports. Use an interactive figure when selection, filtering, synchronized playback, 3D rotation, or access to many records materially improves interpretation. Interactivity should expose additional detail, not hide the primary conclusion.

Every interactive figure must have a static counterpart generated from the same validated inputs. The static view must communicate the primary result independently, not show controls or instruct readers to visit the website.

For a static asset, use MyST's `figure` directive:

```markdown
:::{figure} ./images/figures/generated/example.svg
:label: fig-example
:alt: Concise description of the plotted data and visual encoding.
:width: 100%

Caption describing the result, panels, units, sample sizes, and provenance.
:::
```

For an interactive figure, keep generated HTML under `interactive/` and provide a static placeholder:

```markdown
:::{iframe} ./interactive/example.html
:label: fig-example
:width: 100%
:title: Short accessible title for the interactive figure
:placeholder: ./images/figures/generated/example.svg

One caption shared by the interactive and static views.
:::
```

Generated HTML belongs in `interactive/` and must be listed through `project.static_files` in `myst.yml`. Embed it with the MyST `iframe` directive using a page-relative URL and provide a meaningful `:placeholder:` image for PDF and other static exports. The placeholder must communicate the primary scientific result without requiring interaction.

- Use stable, unique labels and page-relative paths so cross-references survive reordering.
- Put explanatory science in the manuscript caption, not only in the HTML application.
- Give interactive controls semantic markup, keyboard access, accessible names, responsive layout, and a useful initial state.
- Generate both outputs deterministically and verify interactive plus static rendering at desktop and mobile sizes.
- Preview with `myst start`; use `myst build --html` to catch path and static-asset errors.

## Reproducible analysis and data sources

All analysis code and derived manuscript outputs must be reproducible from public P3 cloud data. Use versioned DANDI/NWB assets or project S3 files as the primary source of truth.

- Commit analysis and extraction code, declared dependencies, tests, small derived snapshots, generated outputs, and provenance/checksum records.
- Do not depend on untracked desktop files, private paths, mounted drives, hidden notebook state, or manual image edits. Builds must work from a fresh clone after installing declared dependencies.
- Keep primary NWB, imaging, video, and other large acquisition files in DANDI or S3. Stream them or generate a documented, checksum-verified subset when a compact input is needed.
- If cloud extraction is too expensive for every build, commit the smallest scientifically sufficient intermediate under `figure_sources/data/` or `figure_sources/media/`. The same pull request must include extraction code and provenance recording source asset IDs/paths, Dandiset or S3 URLs, versions, retrieval dates, checksums, analysis parameters, exclusions, and the intermediate checksum.
- Figure generators should consume committed intermediates by default. Do not make ordinary tests, MyST builds, or figure generation depend on downloading full NWBs, videos, or imaging stores. Provide a separate documented refresh command for maintainers.
- Local caches are permitted only as optional accelerators; cache presence must not affect results.
- When an upstream cloud asset changes, refresh all dependent snapshots, provenance hashes, static figures, interactive outputs, and tests in the same pull request.

### Example workflow for analyses across many NWB files

Figure 8 demonstrates the intended pattern for an analysis that must read many large NWB files. Opening and processing every NWB during each test, figure build, or MyST preview would be slow and would make routine builds depend on network availability. Instead, separate the workflow into an expensive **extraction stage** and a fast **presentation stage**:

1. **Define the intermediate.** Store only the scientifically necessary derived values in a compact, deterministic CSV or JSON file under `figure_sources/data/`. Include stable session/asset identifiers so every row can be traced back to its source NWB.
2. **Write a cloud-backed extractor.** Commit a script under `scripts/` that discovers or opens the versioned DANDI/NWB or S3 assets, performs the analysis, validates coverage and exclusions, and writes the intermediate plus source URLs, asset IDs/paths, retrieval date, parameters, and checksums.
3. **Commit the result.** Commit the intermediate and provenance with the extractor. This is an intentional derived publication snapshot, not an untracked cache. Reviewers should be able to inspect its values without rerunning a multi-hour cloud analysis.
4. **Build figures from the intermediate.** Static and interactive figure generators must read the committed snapshot rather than reopening all NWBs. Tests and `uv run build-publication-figures` must therefore work offline after a fresh clone and dependency installation.
5. **Refresh deliberately.** Rerun the expensive extractor only when source assets, inclusion rules, or analysis logic change. Commit the refreshed intermediate, provenance/checksums, generated static and interactive outputs, and updated tests in the same pull request. Optional download caches may speed up this refresh but are never committed or treated as the source of truth.

For the behavior figure, the stages map to repository files as follows:

- `scripts/extract_running_statistics.py` streams running-speed series and named interval tables from the public Neuropixels and mesoscope NWBs, and reads the corresponding SLAP2 Harp encoder/stimulus files from project S3. It computes common 50 ms running summaries across the available P3 sessions and writes the committed `figure_sources/data/running-statistics.json` intermediate. The JSON retains session-level block summaries, downsampled example profiles, coverage, exclusions, source asset manifests, calibration, and checksums.
- Refreshing that many-session intermediate is an explicit maintenance operation:

	```bash
	uv run --with h5py --with harp-python --with numpy --with remfile \
		python scripts/extract_running_statistics.py \
		--cache-dir /tmp/openscope-p3-running-cache
	```

	The cache is optional. Removing it increases download time but must not change the JSON values.
- `scripts/extract_behavior_excerpts.py` separately writes `figure_sources/data/behavior-excerpts.json`, a compact synchronized excerpt for representative Neuropixels, mesoscope, and SLAP2 sessions.
- `scripts/extract_behavior_static_frames.py` extracts representative public S3 camera frames into `figure_sources/media/behavior-viewer-static/` and records source URLs, ETags, target/decoded times, display transforms, and output checksums in `behavior-static-frames.provenance.json`.
- `scripts/extract_pupil_event_responses.py` streams the released P3 NWBs, aligns pupil area and processed forward running speed to the same context and matched-control stimulus-table `start_time` values, applies documented signal quality control and context-specific baselines, and writes the committed `figure_sources/data/pupil-event-responses.json` intermediate plus provenance.
- `scripts/extract_neuropixels_event_responses.py` streams four versioned Neuropixels NWBs from one mouse, computes native 2.5 ms context and matched-control SDFs over −0.75 to 0.75 s (standard, sensorimotor, sequence) or −1.5 to 1.5 s (duration) with a 10 ms causal exponential time constant, 10τ support, and hidden pre-padding, retains every 2.5 ms mean-SDF sample, reads Units-table firing rates, sorter labels, and peak-to-valley durations, derives same-session optotagged SST and waveform-based RS/FS classes, maps exact and canonical parent areas plus their Allen graph order through the pinned `iblatlas` ontology, computes event-specific Rastermap 1.0 ranks, and writes committed metadata plus compressed quantized SDF atlases for the interactive unit-response explorer.
- The routine command `uv run build-publication-figures` reads these committed intermediates and media files to produce both `interactive/behavior-viewer.html` and `images/figures/generated/synchronized-behavior.svg`. It does not recompute the many-NWB running analysis.

Use the same architecture for future figures that aggregate units, receptive fields, anatomical coverage, response metrics, or other values across many NWB files: cloud extractor → committed checksummed intermediate → deterministic static and interactive renderers.

### Derived binary data

Compact display data for an interactive figure may be committed when it is reproducibly derived from versioned source data. Keep primary and analysis-scale data in their external archive.

Use a browser-readable format appropriate to the payload. Existing figures use JSON or base64-encoded typed arrays for smaller data and separate gzip-compressed typed arrays for larger data. Include the metadata needed to interpret the payload and retain source and output checksums when the generator already produces them.

Commit one canonical copy under `figure_sources/data/` or `figure_sources/media/<figure-name>/`. When an interactive page needs the data beside its generated HTML, `uv run build-publication-figures` creates an ignored deployment copy under `interactive/`, which MyST copies into the ignored `_build/` site output. Do not commit or edit the deployment copy. The binary file-size and maintainer-review rules above still apply.

## Using AI assistants effectively

This repository is structured to support agentic AI workflows: the manuscript, source data snapshots, provenance, figure generators, generated outputs, tests, and build commands are all available in one clone. We currently recommend using **5.6 SOL**.

1. Clone the repository locally, open the repository root in an agentic coding environment, and give the assistant access to the complete clone.
2. Ask the assistant to read `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and any repository or directory-specific instruction files before planning or editing.
3. Create a focused branch from the latest `main`.
4. Describe the requested manuscript, analysis, or figure change and point to the relevant issue, file, figure label, source data, or expected behavior.
5. Ask the assistant to trace the owning source or generator before editing and to preserve unrelated changes.
6. Ask it to implement the change end to end: update source data or code, regenerate static and interactive outputs, update captions and provenance, and add or update tests.
7. Have the assistant run the repository checks and report the changed files, validation results, and any assumptions or exclusions.
8. Review the manuscript text, scientific values, figures, captions, source links, and final diff. Correct any mistakes.
9. Ask the assistant to open a focused pull request containing only the related source, generated outputs, provenance, and tests. The pull request description should summarize the scientific change and validation results.

For example:

> Update Figure 4's session colors to the supplied RGB values. Trace the palette to its source, update static and interactive outputs without changing unrelated figures, add a regression test, run the publication checks, and summarize the diff for review.

## Checks

Run these before opening a pull request:

```bash
uv run --extra dev ruff check .
uv run --extra dev pytest
uv run build-publication-figures
git diff --exit-code -- interactive images/figures/generated
myst build --html
```
